# Assessment Report Data Files

The source code repository does not contain any examples of client assessment reports
since they contain confidential information.  There are some **Jupyter Notebook** script 
files located in the `notebook` folder that were used to generate the following data files.
These data files are used to parse and extract the required text from the client assessment 
report documents.

    data/template_sections.json   # Defines report sections to be parsed.
    data/template_tables.json     # Defines report tables to be parsed.
    data/template_keywords.csv    # Defines keywords used for simlarity search.

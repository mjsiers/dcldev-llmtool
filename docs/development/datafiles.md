# Assessment Report Data Files

The source code repository does not contain any examples of a client assessment report
since they contain confidential information.  There are some `notebook` script files that
were used to generate the following list of data files.  These data files are used for
parsing and extracting the text information from the client assessment report documents.

    data/template_sections.json   # Defines report sections to be parsed.
    data/template_tables.json     # Defines report tables to be parsed.
    data/template_keywords.csv    # Defines keywords used for simlarity search.
